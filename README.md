### About this mod
**T**his mod is designed to make the game more diverse and unpredictable.
**A**s you expand your base or simply explore the surface of Nauvis, you will find abandoned constructions left behind by someone else, among those will be sorages with useful resources, deserted production lines, as well as whole complexes for the mass production of various parts.
**A**nd be careful! Sometimes a find can be dangerous. And do not expect that every find will be easy to use.

### Current state
Over 100 area templates including their variations, which may be one of the following:
- up to 64x64 tiles in size
- static, randomized or even dynamic
- with rich or poor prizes
- ruined (partially or fully)
- harmless or dangerous
- can gift you with new technologies or unique recipes, or not ;)
*And much more in future updates...

### How it works
Only newly generated chunks (zones) affected. So dont worry about already explored territory.
No dependencies. You can freely enable or disable this mod in the middle of the game.
Solo/multiplayer/dedicate/pvp - frendly (in teory). Not tested well enough. Anyway, multi-forces/surfaces support added for multiplayer/pvp game sessions.
No noticeable drops of FPS or UPS even on huge maps.

### Your own areas
You can add your own madden areas. Just fork [ZADV_example](https://github.com/iZlovreD/ZADV_example "ZADV_example"), modify, and share it.
All you need is check areas.lua file and read description inside.
